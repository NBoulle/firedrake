Getting in touch
================

Should you wish to get in touch with the Firedrake development team,
for help, feature requests, bugs, or just to say hello, you can do so
in a number of different ways.

GitHub discussions
------------------

The go to place for asking for help is `GitHub discussions
<https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/discussions>`__. For support,
please ask a question under the `Firedrake support category
<https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/discussions/categories/firedrake-support>`__.
We're also always very happy to accept third-party contributions to Firedrake.

Slack |slack-badge|

Much of the day to day development discussion for Firedrake takes
place on our `slack channel <https://firedrakeproject.slack.com>`__.
This is open to all, but you must request an invite to join the
channel, which you can do by `visiting this page
<https://firedrakeproject.herokuapp.com/>`__ (or clicking the slack
badge above).  Should this not work for whatever reason, please get in
touch via GitHub discussions.

The `slack IRC gateway
<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connecting-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP>`__
is enabled for this channel, so you can connect via IRC if you wish
after signing up.

Mailing list
------------

Please join the Firedrake mailing list: firedrake@imperial.ac.uk.  This is a
very low traffic list but it does carry important announcements, for example
when we change a user-facing interface. Join the list on `this page
<mailing_list_>`_.
